# 🛡️ Phishing Awareness Quiz

A lightweight, interactive phishing awareness training tool designed to **educate anyone through real-world examples and visuals** 

## 📌 Why I Built This

My grandma recently fell for a bank scam and lost $1,000.  
As someone working in IT, I regularly hear from faculty, staff, and students who fall victim to phishing emails, job scams, and fake login pages.  

The problem?  
Most cybersecurity “training” is either too technical, too boring, or too easy to ignore and buried in onboarding emails no one ever reads.

I wanted to build something different:  
- **Real examples** of actual phishing tactics I've seen firsthand  
- **Visual learning** using screenshots of scam emails, popups, and login pages  
- **Engaging questions** that explain *why* something is a scam, not just whether it is  
- A tool that helps **protect vulnerable groups** like the elderly and college students  

## 🧠 What It Does

- Presents 12 hand-crafted questions —> a mix of multiple choice, image-based, and true/false  
- Covers topics like fake job offers, urgent password reset emails, crypto scams, impersonation DMs, and more  
- Requires 100% accuracy to pass, the goal is to *learn*, not just guess  
- Offers explanations for incorrect answers to encourage learning 
- Generates a downloadable certificate for users who score 100%

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS only)
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Designed to run **entirely in the browser**
